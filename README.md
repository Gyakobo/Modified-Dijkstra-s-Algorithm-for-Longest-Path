## Introduction

To adapt Dijkstra's algorithm to find the longest path instead of the shortest, we need to make a few key modifications. Dijkstra's algorithm is designed to find the shortest path in a graph by always expanding the shortest known distance. To find the longest path, we need to adjust this logic.
